# Stochastic-Numerical-Methods-

This repository is part of my work in the lesson of Stochastic Numerical Methods in my MS.c in Applied Mathematical Sciences in NTUA,
under the scientific guidance of Dr.Papapantoleon.
All the different files in python are subject to chapters of this lesson.

In order to run the uploaded files you have to install python 3 from here https://www.python.org/downloads/ or (preferred) to download Anaconda from
here https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual and open Jupyter Notebook. 

Hope you find it helpful in order to understand the implementation of numerical methods in staochastic processes.
